# Experience

I built 2 web and 2 mobile apps by using React, React Native, Next.js, Expo, Supabase, and TailwindCSS.

Outside of web and mobile, I'm a passionate runner, husband, and dad.

# Connect

Anyway, that's enough about me.

I'm looking for my first web or mobile developer role and ready break into the tech industry. If you think I might be a good fit for your organization, shoot me an email at timtb.dev@gmail.com and let's chat.
