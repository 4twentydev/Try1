# Experience

Since 2017, I've been actively working on personal projects to enhance my skills.
During this time, I built two web and two mobile applications using technologies
such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Kotlin, and open sourced them on GitHub.

Outside of frontend development, I'm a passionate runner, husband, and dad.

# Connect

Anyway, that's enough about me.

I'm looking for my first web or mobile developer role and ready break into the tech industry. If you think I might be a good fit for your organization, shoot me an email at timtb.dev@gmail.com and let's chat.
